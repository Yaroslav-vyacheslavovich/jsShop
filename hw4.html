        <div class="text"><p>Whenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass it with a casual word:</p>
            <p>'He is in Melbourne now.'</p>
            <p>She had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise? She tried to weigh each side of the question. 
                In her home anyway she had shelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her life about her. 
                Of course she had to work hard, both in the house and at business. 
                What would they say of her in the Stores when they found out that she had run away with a fellow? 
                Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place would be filled up by advertisement. Miss Gavan would be glad. 
                She had always had an edge on her, especially whenever there were people listening.</p>
            <p>'Miss Hill, don't you see these ladies are waiting?'</p>
            <p>'Look lively, Miss Hill, please.'</p>
            <p>She wouldn't cry many tears at leaving the Stores.</p>
